# Oregon Sea Grant Sencha Apps

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for student developers
- [Directory](docs/directory.md) outline of the projects
- [Cordova/PhoneGap's config.xml](docs/config.xml.md) deserves its own description

## Heads Up

### Sencha Stores Load Once

The only way to reload data in the apps is to restart the app.

### Analytics Are Basic

Current view, geolocation events, a generic error event, and opened links are captured.

### No Localhost Development

You must use an emulator or device to run these apps. It was the only way to get Google analytics to work.
